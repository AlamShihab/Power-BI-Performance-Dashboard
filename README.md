# Power BI Performance Dashboard 🚀

## Overview 🎯
Welcome to the **Power BI Performance Dashboard**! This project focuses on creating a **dynamic and interactive business performance report** in Power BI. It is designed to showcase advanced **data modeling, DAX functions, and visualization techniques**. The report helps in analyzing key business metrics, comparing performance trends, and identifying areas of growth and concern. This project is perfect for your **portfolio** and will demonstrate your expertise in **data analytics and business intelligence**.

## About This Project 📊
This Power BI dashboard was built to analyze business performance using a **fictional plant manufacturing company's dataset**. The report provides **actionable insights** by leveraging various Power BI features. The dataset consists of sales, product hierarchy, and account details, which are transformed into a structured data model. Key aspects of this project include:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Importing raw data from **Excel**, transforming it using **Power Query**, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Modeling:** Creating **relationships** between fact and dimension tables, ensuring efficient data analysis.
- **Advanced DAX Calculations:** Implementing key business metrics such as **Year-to-Date (YTD), Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD), Gross Profit, and Comparative Analysis**.
- **Interactive Dashboard Design:** Utilizing **switch measures, slicers, and dynamic visuals** to enhance usability.
- **Performance Tracking:** Comparing **current and previous year’s performance** using **conditional formatting and key visualizations**.

## Project Structure 🏗️
The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Preparation 📊**  
   - Importing data from **Excel** into **Power Query**.
   - Making **small adjustments** and **creating virtual tables**.

2. **Data Modeling 🔧**  
   - Building **DAX measures** and **calculated columns**.

3. **Report Visualization 🎨**  
   - Designing an **interactive layout**.
   - Applying **conditional formatting** for better insights.

4. **Final Review & Publishing 🚀**  
   - Reviewing the report and **publishing** it for use.

## Features Implemented 🏆
✅ **Dynamic Switch Measures** (Sales, Gross Profit, Quantity)  
✅ **Prior Year & Year-to-Date Comparisons**  
✅ **Custom Date Tables & Filtering Techniques**  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard with KPIs & Trends**  
✅ **Conditional Formatting for Key Metrics**  

## Functions Used in This Project 🛠️
Here are some key **DAX functions** used in this Power BI project:

- **SUM()** – Aggregates column values.
- **CALCULATE()** – Modifies the context of a calculation.
- **TOTALYTD()** – Computes the year-to-date total.
- **SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()** – Returns data from the same period in the previous year.
- **MAX()** – Returns the maximum value in a column.
- **SELECTEDVALUE()** – Retrieves a selected value from a slicer.
- **DIVIDE()** – Performs division with error handling.
- **SWITCH()** – Creates conditional logic for dynamic calculations.
- **REMOVE DUPLICATES** – Ensures unique values in dimension tables.
- **FILTER()** – Allows dynamic row filtering.
- **NEW MEASURE/TABLE** – Used to create calculated measures and tables.
- **ENTER DATA** – Manually add reference tables for slicers.
